## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and forecast CO₂ emission patterns across Southeast Asia as part of regional energy transition and decarbonization studies.  
It combines **data analysis, visualization, and interactive exploration** to help policymakers, researchers, and energy professionals understand emission dynamics in ASEAN nations.

**Key Objectives:**
- CO₂ Emission Forecast Comparison - All ASEAN Countries
- Visualize Emission Intensity Geographically and Temporally  
- Provide Interactive Comparisons CO2 emission Trends Over Time

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for the interactive dashboard  
- **Plotly Express** and **Matplotlib** for visualization  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  

---

## Features
- **Map View** — Visualize CO₂ emission intensity across ASEAN countries  
- **Line Chart View** — Analyze emission trends over time  
- **Bar Chart View** — Compare emissions by country per selected year  
- **Interactive Sidebar** — Adjust year and visualization type dynamically
