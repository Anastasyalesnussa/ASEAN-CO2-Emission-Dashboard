## 📘 Project Overview

This project aims to explore and forecast CO₂ emission patterns across Southeast Asia as part of regional energy transition and decarbonization studies.  
It combines **data analysis, visualization, and interactive exploration** to help policymakers, researchers, and energy professionals understand emission dynamics in ASEAN nations.

**Key Objectives:**
- Analyze annual CO₂ emissions per capita for ASEAN countries  
- Visualize emission intensity geographically and temporally  
- Provide interactive comparisons and year-based analysis
